# Game Dialog Translator

GameDialogTranslator is a Node.js script that performs real-time on-screen text translation for Japanese games. This tool uses OCR to recognize the text on the screen, and translates it into English using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It also keeps track of the conversation context to improve the translation outcome.

Written with the target game being _Yokai Watch 4_ in mind and targets the dialog box in the bottom of the screen. However, it should be possible to adapt it to other games as well.
